# Python Automation Tool

## Goal
A CLI-based tasks automation tool that reads CSV files, processes the data, and outputs the results as JSON.

## Structure
- `data/`: Contains input CSVs and output JSONs.
- `src/`: Source code.
- `tests/`: Unit tests.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3+ is installed.
2. Run the tool:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

## Skills Used
- File I/O (CSV, JSON)
- Python Data Structures (Lists, Dicts)
- CLI Argument Parsing (optional/future)
- Modular Verification
